            Beth Lipman’s contemporary work, "Mixed Fruit Centerpiece (III)," is a towering arrangement of clear glass bananas, apples, grapes, and snails, supported by a decorative glass bowl. The decorative rim of the bowl explodes with ghostly leaves, fruit, and grapes. One large fruit sits at the top, allowing the entire piece to take on the lumpy conical shape of a decorated Christmas tree. A few inches from the foot of the bowl, there is a fallen, unidentifiable piece of fruit. The object is estimated to weigh 15 to 35 lbs, and stand 2’ in height by .8’ in circumference. This piece was designed and manufactured by Beth Lipman. She uses a combination of free-blowing, sculpting, and gluing to create an overwhelming effect. The glass is colorless and clear. The work is truly a testament to Lipman’s incredible technical skill as a craftman. Behind these formal decisions, there is a deeper call to feelings of mortality and consumerist guilt. Mixed Fruit Centerpiece (III) is one component of a much larger, site-specific installation by Lipman.
            <br><br>
            The installation, called “After You’re Gone,” is a room overflowing with elegantly arranged towers of glass fruits, bowls, cups, vases, platters, bouquets of flowers, and snails. The truly overwhelming impact may be somewhat lost in viewing Mixed Fruit Centerpiece (III) apart from its siblings. "After You’re Gone,” revives the 17th century still-life, as a phantom version of itself. Lipman's haunting room of glass both mocks material wealth for its fleeting nature, and laments its refusal to die.
